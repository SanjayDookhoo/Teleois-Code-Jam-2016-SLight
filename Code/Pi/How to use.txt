NB* to run a python file, i.e. x.py, type in terminal "python x.py", without the quotes

To increase usability:
    Multiple pis existing that can be linked together, where each pi must send and receive data to its trailing and leading pis. 
    
    To do:
        In IPAddresses.txt place amount of pi's linked in circular form on the first line.
        For every pi place its IPAddress(hostname -I) in line + 2. 
            Example the second pi of IPAddress 192.168.3.103 will be placed in line 3
        extra new line space at end
        
        Example: for 5 pis:
        
        5
        192.168.3.103
        192.168.3.104
        192.168.3.105
        192.168.3.106
        192.168.3.109
        
        run file genClientServer.py in terminal to generate the client and servers for each file
        run file genPiCode.py in terminal to generate the files for each pi
        copy the files from the "To Copy" folder and copy directly into the generated/piX folders.
        Copy pi folders into pi and enter terminal for that new folder. 
        run file "SLightCore.py" from terminal 
        When all SLightCore.py is running on all pis, the pis will connect together
